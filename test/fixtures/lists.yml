# This model initially had no columns defined. If you add columns to the
# model remove the '{}' from the fixture names and add the columns immediately
# below each fixture, per the syntax in the comments below
#
one: { title: "一つ目", user_id: 1 }
# column: value
#
two: { title: "二つ目", user_id: 1 }
# column: value
three: { title: "三つ目", user_id: 1 }
